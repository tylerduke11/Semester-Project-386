Part 2 Feedback

1. "In the introduction maybe you could describe generally how you are going to evaluate player performance. 
You ask the question "Are the best players getting paid the most?", 
so maybe you could briefly mention how you are quantifying "best" 
(with a more in depth explanation later on in the project of course)."

2. "If you would like, it might be helpful to include some code chunks for the 
reader that show specifics of your data collection process. You break it down 
step by step, so it might be helpful to have some code chunks for each step."

3. "This looks good. I would suggest maybe writing a bit more about the cleaning process. 
You mentioned there were some variables you did not want to include, so it might be a good 
idea to talk about the structure of the data that was scraped and how you decided what to keep and what to throw out."

4. "Hey Tyler, nice post! I'd love to hear a little more about the rows or columns you didn't need 
or maybe share some struggles you had while cleaning. (everyone loves a drama, right?)"
