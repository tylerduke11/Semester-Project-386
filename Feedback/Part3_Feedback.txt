"Great Job on the blog post! I would suggest putting some headers in for each new graphic you are explaining. The graphs are all 
put between plain text and so it's hard to see at first which graph the text is explaining.
In the conclusion, I would also quickly address the most interesting findings you got from the EDA. 
I feel it makes it just a little easier for the reader to walk away with some main ideas to think about."

"I think the analysis is well done in terms of a team’s offense, but I noticed there wasn’t much analysis on a 
team’s defense considering player salaries. I think that maybe it would be more well-rounded to give more attention 
to the team’s defensive metrics, if it is possible to provide those kinds of graphs with the data you collected. 
Other than that, I would say a little summary at the conclusion would be nice to remember what the all the graphs showed."

"I think the graphs are very well done and there is some interesting analysis. I think it would have been cool if you had tied 
the different graphs together more so that they were all answering one specific question or leading to some point, rather than 
just getting random bits of relatively unconnected info."
